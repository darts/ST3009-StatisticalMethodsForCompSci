### Q1

#### (a)  

$0$  
Fx(X) - lim y->X Fx(y) = 0  
Since at that point there is no change

#### (b)

Since $P(x<y) = y$ for $0\leq x \leq 1$  
This is a quarter of the possibilities -> prob = $\frac{1}{4}$ 

#### (c)  

Prob that x < 0 = 0 so we disregard that.  
Prob that x < 0.5 = 0.5

### Q2

#### (a)  

<include graph of pdf>
<include graph of cdf>

$$
CDF(x) = (\frac{x}{2})(\frac{x}{2}) = \frac{x^2}{4}
$$


#### (b)  

Can ignore where x > 2.  
$0.5 \leq x \leq 2$  
$1 - \frac{(0.5^2)}{4} = 0.9375$
